## Preparing embryonic mouse limb sections for ORCA experiment.

#### Reagents
  * 1X PBS (cold and on ice)
	* Tissue-Tek Cryomold 
	* OCT Compound
  * 24- or 96-well plate
  * 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1X PBS (cold)
  * Liquid nitrogen
  * Dry ice

#### Collecting embryo
  1.	Sacrifice the pregnant mouse with a CO2 chamber when the embryos are at the desired stage (basing on observation of the vaginal plug.)
  2.  Take out the uterus, dip briefly in one petri dish of 1X PBS, then place it into another petri dish of 1X PBS.
  3.  Take out one embryo at a time, place it into yet another petri dish of 1X PBS under a dissection scope. 
  4.  Disentangle it from its embryonic membranes using fine tweezers.
  5.  Use a scissor to snip off a limb and place it into a well in the well-plate with 1X PBS. Repeat for all 4 limbs and all embryos.
      (To facilitate, one can chop the embryo into upper and lower halves before snipping off the limbs. One can move snipped off limbs with a flat-headed tweezer by carefully picking up the limb enclosed in a drop of 1X PBS.)
  6.  After all dissections were done, prepare for each limb one well of 4% PFA and another 3 wells of 1X PBS.
  7.  Move each limb into its well of PFA. Nutate/shake at 4C for ~1hr.
  8.  Move each limb into a new well of 1X PBS. Nutate/shake at 4C for 5 minutes. Repeat this for another 2 times.
  9.  Move each limb into an OCT filled cryomold on ice. Submerge the limbs into OCT and orient the limb in a consistent way relative to the mold with 200 uL tips. 
      (If there seems to be a big drop of PBS in OCT, prepare a separate pool of OCT to rinse the limb before transfering to the cryomold.)
  10. After placing all limbs into cryomolds, re-check every limb and adjust their orientations. Proceed reasonably quickly to the next step.
      (Cold OCT is really viscuous. Limbs are unlikely to move drastically and lose their orientations within a short time.)
  11. One at a time, place the cryomolds onto liquid nitrogen until OCT turns completely white.
      (Do not let liquid nitrogen touch OCT. Frozen that way, the OCT block would often inredeamably crack and the sample wasted. Ideally, the cryomold floats like a boat on liquid nitrogen. If it tends to sink, hold it afloat with a long tweezer.)
  12. Place frozen OCT blocks temporarily on dry ice. Covered the dry-ice bucket with foil. Repeat 11. and 12. until all molds are frozen.
  13. Store the molds in -80C.

#### Sectioning the limbs
For sectioning, please refer to https://github.com/BoettigerLab/protocols/blob/master/CryosectioningEmbryos.md, but notice the following modifications:
  1. Forelimb-bud and hindlimb-bud of the same embryo from the same side (right or left) are sectioned together.
  2. The cryomolds are placed at -20°C for 30 minutes to equilibrate.
  3. Limb buds are sectioned from the proximal end along the proximal - distal axis and parallel to the anterior - posterior axis with 8 μm thickness.
  4. Sections of forelimb-bud and hindlimb-bud are placed on the same slide, which is coated with chromium–gelatin.
  5.  Note that for all our samples, we proceed to probe hybridizing immediately without storing the slides in the fridge or freezer.
