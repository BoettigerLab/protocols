### Mixing instructions (per 10 mL total buffer)
* In a 1.5 uL tube measure out 10 mg Glucose Oxidase (yellow powder, stored at -20C) and dissolve it in 500 uL 2x SSC by vortexing
* Add 100 uL disolved Catalase solution (yellow brown liquid, sediment free). Mix gently. Do Not vortex. 
* In a 50 mL flask, add 1 mL 20x SSC
* Add 2 mL of 50% Glucose Solution (stored at RT, filter sterilize)
* Add all 600 uL of enzyme mix
* Gently fill to 10 mL with ddH2O.
	- (avoid mixing in extra air, the point of this buffer is to remove disolved oxygen from the buffer). 
* overlay solution with ~1 cm (2-3 mL) of mineral oil.
	- (this prevents oxygen from the air dissolving back into the buffer)
