# Methods
## Pretreat coverslips
* Wash 40-mm-diameter #1.5 coverslips for 30 min via immersion in:
	* 1:1 mix of 37%(vol/vol) HCl and methanol at room temperature (RT).
* Rinse 3x in DI H2O
* Rinse 1x in 70% Ethanol
* dry at 70C
* in Fume-hood: for 30 min at RT, immerse in silanization solution containing: 
	* 0.1% (vol/vol) triethylamine (Millipore, TX1200) 
	* 0.2% (vol/vol) allyltrichlorosilane (Sigma, 107778)
	* dissolved in chloroform 
* Wash 1x with chloroform 
* Wash 1x with ethanol 
* Bake in a 70 °C oven for 1 h to dehydrate the silane layer.
* Silanized coverslips may be stored at RT in a desiccated chamber for weeks.

## Cell plating, fixation and hybridization
* Coat silanized coverslips with 0.1 mg/mL poly-D-lysine (PDL) diluted in nuclease-free water for 1 min at RT. 
* UV-sterilized coverslips before plating cells.
* Plate cells at desired density, allow to recover 1-36 hrs in incubator before fixation. 
* Fix with 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15714) in 1× PBS for 20 min. 
* Wash three times with 1× PBS, 
* Permeabilize using 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (Sigma, T8787) in 1× PBS for 10 min. 
* Wash three times with 1× PBS.
* incubate for 5 min in a 30% formamide wash buffer, containing:
	*  2× saline-sodium citrate (SSC; ThermoFisher, AM9763) and 
	*  30% (vol/vol) formamide (ThermoFisher, AM9342)
* Hybridize encoding probes in encoding hybridization buffer, containing final conc. of: 
	* 2× SSC, 
	* 30% (vol/vol) formamide, 
	* 0.1% (wt/vol) yeast tRNA (Life Technologies, 15401-011) [Not sure this helps] 
	* 1% (vol/vol) murine RNase inhibitor (New England Biolabs, M0314L) [should not be necessary but often is]
	* 10% (wt/vol) dextran sulfate (Sigma, D8906), 
	* in a humidity-controlled 37 °C incubator for 36 h. 
	* Recommended starting conc. of encoding probes:  100 μM for ~100 gene library. 

## Embedding and Clearing
* prepare de-gassed PA-gel solution.  Final conc:
	* 4% (v/v) 19:1 acrylamide/bis-acrylamide
	* 60 mM Tris-HCl PH 8
	* 0.3 M NaCl
	* fiducial beads (1:500 - 1:200,000)
	* de-gas in vacuum chamber
* Wash samples in PA-gel solution + polymerizing agents:
	* ammonium persulfate. Final conc: (0.03% wt/vol) 
	* TEMED (0.15% v/v).  Fincal conc: (0.15%)
* add 50 uL of gel solution to a glass plate pretreated for 5 min with 1 mL of GelSlick
* aspirated to remove excess PA gel solution
* gently inverted onto this 50-μL droplet to form a thin layer of PA between the coverslip and the glass plate.
	*   (The volume of this gel droplet could be used to control the thickness of this PA film.)
* allowed to cast for 1.5 h at room temperature.
* coverslip and the glass plate were then gently separated, and the PA film washed twice with a digestion buffer consisting of:
	*  0.8 M guanidine-HCl (Sigma, G3272), 
	*  50 mM Tris·HCl pH 8, 
	*  1mM EDTA, and 
	*  0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 
	*  in nuclease-free water
* Digest proteins by covering with digestion buffer supplemented with 1% (vol/vol) proteinase K (New England Biolabs, P8107S) for >12 h in a humidified, 37 °C incubator.
*  wash with 2× SSC three times
*  MERFISH measurements should be performed immediately to minimize opportunity for RNA degradation.  	
	* sample may be stored in 2× SSC supplemented with 0.1% (vol/vol) murine RNase inhibitor at 4 °C for no longer than 24 h.
