## Immunostaining Embryos

#### Reagents
	*	4% PFA in 1X PBS
	*	0.5% Triton-X in 1X PBS
	*	1X PBS
	*	1% BSA in 1X PBS
	*	Antibodies

#### Protocol made for a single slide. Adjust measurements for your needs. 
	*	Slide is kept in a humid chamber throughout the experiment
  1.	Take a mini pap pen and trace a rectangle around your sample. Let dry
  2. 	Add 200uL of fixation solution(4% PFA in 1X PBS) to cover the cells for 10 minutes
  3.	Incubate fixed cell with Permeabilization solution (0.5% Triton-X in PBS) for 10 minutes
  4. 	Add 200 uL of 1% BSA in 1X PBS at room temperature. Leave for 30mins - 1hr
  5. 	Add 200uL of primary antiboy in blocking solution for 1-2hrs in the 4C fridge
  6.	Wash 3X in 1X PBS
  7.	Add 100uL of secondary antibody in blocking solution for 1-2hrs at room temperature
  8.	Wash 3X in PBS
  9. 	Mount the seal chamber with diamond shield. Can be imaged right away or stored at 4C
