# Hybridization with complex oligo-pools
For labeling of RNA or DNA with complex oligo pools. This protocol was written by the Boettiger Lab at Stanford University. It has evolved from previous hybridization protocols using Oligopaints (e.g. Boettiger et al 2016, *Nature*) 

## Sample fixation

### Adherent cells (e.g. IMR90s)
1. Plate cells on 40 mm coverglass at the desired confluency and allow cells to adhere (typically overnight).
2. Fix cells to coverglass by incubating a further 10 min in fixation buffer (4% PFA in PBS).

### Suspended cells (e.g. K562s)
1. Coat 40 mm coverglass with poly-lysine
2. Spin down 2-10 mL of cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube
3. Remove poly-lysine solution
4. Resuspend cells in ~100 uL of fixation buffer (4% PFA in PBS)
5. Add cells in a droplet to the poly-lysine coated coverglass.
6. Spin cells at 3000 rpm in a swinging bucket centrifuge at maximum acceleration for 90 s.
	- Note: holding the pulse spin for 90 s may provide better acceleration.
7. Fix cells to coverglass by incubating a further 10 min in fixation buffer.

### Tissue sections
1. Pre-coat 40 mm coverglass with chromium-gelatin solution.
2. Cryosection tissue sections 4-6 um thick, place in center of coverglass.  
	- Cut sections may be stored at -20C until needed.
3. Fix tissue to gelatin by incubating 10 min in fixation buffer (4% PFA in PBS)

## Sample permeabilization (all sample types)
We recommend 50 or 60 mm petri dishes as containers for the 40mm coverglass during sample treatment 

  1. Incubate fixed sample for 10 minutes in Permeabilization solution (0.5% Triton-X in PBS).
  2. Wash 2X in PBS.
  3. For DNA FISH only: Incubate exactly 5 minutes in 0.1 M HCl.
  4. Wash 3X in PBS.
  5. For DNA FISH only: incubate 0.5 - 1 hr at 37°C in RNaseA solution.
  	 - only necessary if probes are antisense to some RNA transcripts in the locus.
  	 - isolate RNaseA from other work areas. It is easy to contaminate equipment.
  6. Wash 3X in 2X SSC.
  7. Incubate for 35 minutes in 2X SSC + 50% vol/vol formamide and 0.1% Tween.  
  8. Use sample directly in step or store at 4˚C. Coverslips may be stored at 4°C for several days.

## Sample denaturation and hybridization 
0. Setup:
	1. Set heat-block to 90˚C and allow to equilibrate.  
	2. Place hybridization chamber at 42˚C and allow to equilibrate.
	   - a tip box with some dionized water in the bottom woks fine for a hybridization chamber.
	   - the hybridization chamber reduces evaporative effects during hybridization.
1.	Prepare hybridization mix:
	* dilute 1-5 µL of concentrated probe (~1000 ng/uL)
	* in 30 µL of hybrdization buffer. 
	* Hybrdization buffer consists of:
		* 50% formamide
		* 10% dextran sulfate
		* 0.1% tween
		* 2X SSC
		* store in foil at 4C
2.  Gently tap coverslip of cells dry on a Kimwipe. Remove prehybe buffer from sample chamber.
3.  Add diluted probe in hybridization buffer to sample.
  - try to avoid air bubbles
4. Place a 18x18 mm coverglass ontop of the probe
  - this helps to spread out the probe and reduce evaporation.
5. Place the entire petri-dish a top a heat-block preheated to 90C for 3 - 10 min
	- longer denaturation may improve signal
	- we are still exploring if longer denaturation results in a measurable difference in chromatin structure. 
	- a 65˚C denaturation may be sufficient for RNA labeling (still exploring). 
6. Hybridize sample overnight (8-20 hours) at 42°C  


## Post-hybridization 
1. Pre-warm 2X SSC solution to 42°C.
2. Add SSC to sample, return to 42°C for 10 min
3. Remove the 18 mm coverglass from the sample
4. Wash 1x in warm SSC and incubate for 10min in SSC at 42°C.
5. Wash 1x in SSC
6. Post sample for 1 hour in post-fix buffer (8% PFA 2% GA in PBS)
4. Sample may be stored in 2X SSC at 4˚C for up to 2 weeks.
